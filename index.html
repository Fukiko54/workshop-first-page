    <h1>Out of the World</h1> 
    <p>Professional photography that features inanimate object matter is known as still-life photography. Conveying the specific 
      messages with still-life objects to the audience may be difficult, but it is the way to explore mine out of the world.</p>

    <p>The first pictures show the mom and her kids having a fun conversation. I was particular about the position
      of the cranes, such as making the children look like they were talking with their parents facing up, and putting 
      the child on the wing of the parent to express their childhood.</p>
      <img src="images/crane-2.jpg">
      <p>The next picture was taken of the childrenâ€™s cranes playing with each other, and I thought that it would be possible 
        to bring out their enjoyment by making the cranes lie down or at an angle, and by making each line of sight look 
        different.</p>
